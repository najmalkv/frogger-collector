# Frogger Collector: A classic arcade game with a twist.

Frogger is a popular arcade game that was developed in th 80's. The object of the game is to direct frogs to their homes one by one by crossing a busy road and navigating a river full of hazards.

Frogger Collector is a variation from the classic game, where instead of crossing across the player has to collect as many collectables as he can without touching a bug.  Each collectable has different points. The collected points adds up to a score and the highest score is recorded as the highscore.


## How to Run

To run the game open the **index.html** from the root folder in any modern web browser, ie. Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Edge.

You can find the game on my github page [here](https://github.com/najmalkv/frogger-collector).

## How to Play

*  Move the player using the arrow keys on your keyboard.
*  Direct the player towards the collectables(star or key) and collect it. When a player lands on the collectable it is considered as collected.
*  Each collectable has points associated with it, ie. 'star' is 5 points and 'key' is 2 points.
* Be careful not to touch the bugs while you are collecting the collectables because as soon as you make contact with the bug its game over.
* A score is calculated by summing up the points of the collectables you have collected.
* A round ends when the player touchs a bug.
* The highest score from all your rounds is recorded as the highscore. There are no limit to the number of rounds you can play. Keep playing to beat your highscore.
* The score is displayed on the top left corner of play area and the highscore is displayed on the top right corner of the play area.
* Have Fun! :)
